# Web Jotter Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** September 20, 2025

Web Jotter is a local-first browser extension designed to help you save and restore tab sessions and jot down text highlights.

## Data Collection
- Web Jotter **does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information.**
- All saved sessions and highlights are stored **locally on your device** using Chromeâ€™s storage APIs.
- No data is sent to external servers or third parties.

## Permissions
- **Tabs:** Required to read the URLs and titles of open tabs when you explicitly save a session, and to reopen them when restoring.  
- **Storage:** Required to store your saved sessions and highlights locally.  
- **Host permissions:** Required so the extension can capture URLs of tabs you choose to save.  

## Future Features
Optional features such as syncing across devices may be introduced later. If implemented, they will be opt-in, and this policy will be updated to explain how data is handled.
